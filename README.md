# goukanren

A golang-idiomatic uKanren, perhaps a decent starting point for a datalog, if
you were to write one in Go.

The design is based heavily on micro-Kanren as described in the paper:

Hemann, J., & Friedman, D. P. (2013). "microkanren: A Minimal Functional
Core for Relational Programming". Workshop on Scheme and Functional
Programming, Alexandria, United States.

## Building

```sh
go build -o goukanren .
```

## Example use

```sh
> goukanren
go-uKanren v1.0.0
>> TODO come up with a good example that isn't ancestors-based.
```
